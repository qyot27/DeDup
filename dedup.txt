DeDup 0.1 by Loren Merritt, Copyright 2004
based on Dup 2.20 beta 1 by Donald Graft/Klaus Post

DeDup is an Avisynth filter, intended to remove duplicate frames in the
interest of compression quality and speed. In some cases, it can also reduce
noise or compression artifacts in the source.

DeDup differs from Dup in that it completely drops the duplicate frames,
rather than keeping several copies of each in the output stream. Then, to
compensate for the dropped frames, DeDup outputs a Matroska-compatible
timecode file to put the remaining frames back in the right places.

This is a two pass filter. While my algorithm could work with one pass, it
wouldn't fit in the Avisynth API.



Usage example:

--- first pass ---

LoadPlugin("DeDup.dll")
AVISource("blah.avi")
DupMC(log="blah.dup.txt")

-------------------
--- second pass ---

LoadPlugin("DeDup.dll")
AVISource("blah.avi")
DeDup(threshold=1.0, maxcopies=10, maxdrops=4, log="blah.dup.txt", times="blah.times.txt")

-------------------



First Pass Options:

DupMC(clip c, bool chroma, string log)

chroma:
	default: true
	Use chroma planes when calculating differences.
	(This is the same as in Dup)

log:
	default: none. required.
	File name to save dup metrics for the second pass.

DupMC does not modify the frames passed through it.
It only generates the log file.



Second Pass Options:

DeDup(clip c, float threshold, bool show, bool dec,
      int maxcopies, int maxdrops, bool blend,
      string log, string times, string ovr, string debug)

threshold:
	range: 0 - 100
	default: 1.0
	Consecutive frames that differ by less that this much will be merged into
	a single output frame, taken from the end of the merged sequence.
	(This uses the same units as in Dup)

show:
	default: false
	Print diagnostic information into each frame.

dec:
	default: true
	Drop frames. Without this, DeDup won't do much. But you might want to
	disable this with show=true, to see the frames that would be dropped.

maxcopies:
	range: 1 - 20
	default: 12
	Break any string of duplicates longer than this.
	(This is the same as in Dup)

maxdrops:
	range: 1 - maxcopies
	default: 3
	Break any string of drops longer than this.
	Don't set this above 4-5 if you want to display subtitles, because many media
	players can't update the subtitles until they get a new video frame.

blend:
	default: false
	Instead of keeping the last frame from a string of dupes, take the average
	of all the frames in the string.
	(This would be the same as in Dup, but it's currently broken)

log:
	default: none. required.
	The same file you created in the first pass.

times:
	default: none. required.
	File to write matroska timecodes to.

ovr:
	default: none.
	File to override settings on a per-frame basis. See below for format.

debug:
	default: none.
	File to write the same information as with show=true.



Override File Format:
Example:

  0-350 threshold=.5
350-900 threshold=1
100 k
200-220 ddk


Any line not beginning with a frame number is ignored as a comment.
Each line is of the format:
	startframe-endframe option [more options]
or
	frame option [more options]

Option overrides accepted:

A string matching /[kd]+/:
	This forces the frame(s) to be (k) kept or (d) considered dups.
	Forcing a dup does not necessarily cause that frame to be dropped;
	it's still subject to maxdrops.
	The string of [kd]s will be repeated as necessary to fill the frame range.

threshold=%f
	This is the same as the global threshold option.




Tips:
	If you're doing other CPU-intensive filtering before DeDup, you can save
time (at the cost of space) by saving the first pass to a huffyuv, and then
running the secong pass from that, instead of repeating the other filters.
